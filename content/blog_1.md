It is said that thou mayst gain entry to Moloch's sanctuary, if thou darest, from a place where the ground vibrateth in the deepest depths of Gehennom.  Thou needs must have the aid of three magical items.  The pure sound of a silver bell shall announce thee.  The terrible runes, read from Moloch's book, shall cause the earth to tremble mightily.  The light of an enchanted candelabrum shall show thee the way.
