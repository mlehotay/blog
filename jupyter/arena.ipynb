    "I have been thinking about combat in RPG games lately and wondering if I could come up with a way to model combat that I could use for machine learning. I'd like to be able to make decisions about the best weapon to wield and the best armor to wear, and to be able to predict the odds of surviving a particular battle. The obvious approach is to simulate the battle many times and use statistics!"

    "Our combat system will be pretty basic. For simplicity it will only use melee weapons and not have any missile weapons or magic. Other than that it will work like many tabletop role-playing games: fighters take turns attacking each other and the outcome of each attack is randomly determined by rolling dice. A regular set of dice contains dice with 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20 sides.\n",

    "  * **Health** or (**hit points**) is the amount of injury the fighter can withstand.\n",

    "To attack, roll a 20-sided die to see if you hit your opponent. You need to roll a certain number or higher to hit. The formula is `22 - level - armor_class`. For example, to hit an opponent with armor class 10, a level 1 fighter needs to roll an 11 or higher (22 - 1 - 10 = 11).\n",
